EchoNet2Fish
============

**EchoNet2Fish** is a package of functions for the [R programming language](http://www.r-project.org/).  **EchoNet2Fish** estimates fish abundance from acoustic surveys combined with catch in nets (typically midwater trawls or gill nets).
An example of how to use the functions in **EchoNet2Fish** is given in this [vignette](https://rawgit.com/JVAdams/EchoNet2Fish/master/vignettes/Intro.html).
